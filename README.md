# Project: Recipes

## Description
In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website using HTML only as a part of The Odin Project curriculum. The website will consist of a main index page and a few other pages containing recipes.

## Steps
First, I created several HTML files: one for the main page, the rest for the recipe pages (buns, scrambled eggs, creamy pasta). All of them have an HTML boilerplate included. The recipe pages are linked to the main page and vice versa.

Second, I filled the buns recipe page with content. In the buns.html file, I used the following tags:
- '<h2>' to divide the page's content into sections (description, ingredients, steps);
- 'img' to attach a picture of the dish;
- '<ul>' and '<ol>' for the ingredient list and the cooking steps respectively.
