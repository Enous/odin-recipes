Project: Recipes

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website using HTML only. The website will consist of a main index page and a few other pages containing recipes.

First, I created several HTML files: one for the main page, the rest for the recipe pages. All of them have
an HTML boilerplate included. The recipe pages are linked to the main page and vice versa.
