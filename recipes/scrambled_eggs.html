        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A tasty breakfast dish that can be made in 
            under five minutes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk (1 tsp)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add eggs and milk to a mixing vessel (like
                a bowl or a large cup) and stir until
                combined.</li>
            <li>Brush a nonstick pan with oil and heat
                it over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pour in the mixture. Stir the eggs with a
                spatula every few seconds, scraping along
                the bottom and edges of the pan.</li>
            <li>When the eggs start looking like
                soft curds, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>Done.</li>
        </ol>
